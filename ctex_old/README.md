# ctex README

This is a syntax highlighter for ctex, which I write using alternate keys from wincompose. I wrote a compiler for it to do ctex→tex→pdf and was upset because my math did not look pretty. I am publishing this because I could not get the copy-paste solution to work due to a .obsolete folder gobbling up all of my work.

## Features

colors. im too lazy to list them.

## Requirements

this requires you to have my personal compiler, so its not useful for you. unless you want to reverse-engineer it ig.

## Extension Settings

nope

## Known Issues

everything stays green under the √⸣ which i can fix in like 8.4 seconds but nah

## Release Notes

i release you from all curses that you have been put under, including bad luck curses, "share this to avoid" curses, etc.

### 0.0.1

i suppose this should be 1.0.0 but nah

## Working with Markdown
^neat!

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.

## For more information
^wow i love information
